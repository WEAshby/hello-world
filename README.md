Hello, my name is William Ashby. I will be turning 40 May 28th. I have a wonderful wife and two children. I was introduced to I.T. in 1999 at New Albany Senior High School and attended Prosser School of technology for Computer operations/networking. The years after highschool were spent on traveling the world on my BMX bike until 2007. I started employment between trips for BMX at Plumbers Supply Co in 2007 to current.  In 2010, my sponsorships were ended in cycling and I have been a life learner since, navigating many various roles at my current employment including all operational positions, sales positions , and currently as of last year ERP specialist in the I.T. department.
